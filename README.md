# FarcGIS
A mini GIS software developed by C# and ArcEngine
I personally built this software during October to December, 2013 with C# and ArcEngine. This software can import shapefiles, and process these files in some simple function inlcuding spatial operation, analysis, layer administration. And also some spatial algorithms are tested in this software.
